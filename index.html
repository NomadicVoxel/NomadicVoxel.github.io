	<p>Hi, I'm <em>Clancy Clawson</em>, and I make stuff.</p>
	<p>I have a bachelors in Web Development and Design, 
		but these days I'm working with 3D printing and laser engraving mostly. 
		Still, I plan to keep practicing code and making stuff, and have a few projects in mind.</p>
	<p>Thanks for having a look and sticking around. Feel free to write to me, my discord is NomadicVoxel#5149</p>
